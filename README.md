# PKSMNX
Nintendo Switch homebrew save editor for Pokemon games.

Supports:
- Sword/Sheild
- Scarlet/Violet

## Features
- Changing EVs and IVs

## Notes and Bugs
- Pokemon info is currently only in English as PKSM-Core does not have the newest information. Its fairly easy to add so it should be in the next update.
- selecting an empty space in a box will cause a crash.
- You can't change the trainer name even tho it is an input box
